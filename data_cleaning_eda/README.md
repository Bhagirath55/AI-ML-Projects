# 🧼 Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that walks through the data cleaning and exploratory data analysis process on a sample dataset.

## 📌 Objective

The primary goal of this notebook is to prepare raw data for analysis or machine learning by:
- Identifying and handling data quality issues
- Exploring data patterns and statistical properties
- Gaining initial insights to guide further modeling

## 📋 Tasks Performed

### 1. Data Loading
- Imported necessary libraries
- Loaded the dataset using `pandas`

### 2. Data Inspection
- Displayed basic info (`.info()`, `.describe()`)
- Previewed rows to understand structure and content

### 3. Missing Value Treatment
- Identified missing values across columns
- Applied strategies like imputation or deletion

### 4. Duplicate Handling
- Checked for and removed duplicate entries

### 5. Data Type Corrections
- Ensured columns had appropriate data types for analysis

### 6. Outlier Detection
- Used visualization (boxplots, histograms) to identify potential outliers

### 7. Data Visualization
- Performed univariate and bivariate visual analysis using:
  - Histograms
  - Boxplots
  - Countplots
  - Heatmaps

### 8. Correlation Analysis
- Generated a correlation matrix to understand relationships between numerical features

## 📈 Outcome

The cleaned and analyzed dataset is ready for:
- Feature engineering
- Model building
- Further statistical analysis

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
